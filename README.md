# Full Stack Development-ii

# Course Description

This course builds on the fundamental knowledge and skills required for full stack development (MEAN
Stack). Students learn Angular as a front-end framework, implement NoSQL databases (MongoDB) and
work with Express framework and Node.js environment. Students enrolled in this course are expected to
have prior working knowledge of HTML & CSS and JavaScript ES6 Node.js and Express (COMP3123).
Knowledge of other JavaScript frameworks is an asset.

# Course Outcomes

At the end of this course, the student will reliably demonstrate the ability to:
1. Design and implement a simple front-end web solution using Angular.
2. Utilize native features of Node.js using built-in modules.
3. Implement a data storage solution using MongoDB.
4. Store and retrieve data to a MongoDB using Mongoose ODM.
5. Implement and consume REST APIs with Node.js and Express.
